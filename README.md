## Description

This is a project that converted PSD design into multi-page, functional, and responsive website. To create a reponsible design, I made three different breakpoints (1024px, 768px, and 480ox) for screen display by using media queries. 

## Languages

Built by using HTML and SASS.

The objective of this project was to learn about the benefits of using SASS instead of CSS which has helped me to write clean codes.
